What are Controllers?
Controllers in Spring Boot are Java classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP
requests and returning an appropriate response. They act as intermediaries between the client
(usually a web browser or a mobile app) and the applicationâ€™s business logic.

The Role of Controllers in Spring Boot
Controllers serve as the entry point for requests to your application.
They receive requests, process the necessary data, and determine the appropriate response.
This can include returning HTML pages, JSON data for APIs, or even redirecting to other URLs.

Handling Different Types of Requests

Handling GET Requests
GET requests are used to retrieve data from the server.  the `@PathVariable` annotation
is used to extract the `id` from the URL path.

Handling POST Requests
POST requests are used to send data to the server.

Handling PUT and DELETE Requests
PUT requests are used to update existing data, while DELETE requests are used to remove data.
