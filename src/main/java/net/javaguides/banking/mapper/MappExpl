The AccountMapper class is responsible for converting between the Account entity
and the AccountDto (Data Transfer Object). This is useful because it helps
separate the concerns of your application by ensuring that your service and
controller layers don't have to deal directly with the database entities,
which might contain additional information or relationships that aren't
needed in the response.
