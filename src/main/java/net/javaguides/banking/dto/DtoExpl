A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a design pattern used to transfer
data between different parts of an application, often between the
client and server layers in a software system. The primary purpose
of a DTO is to encapsulate the data and move it
efficiently across the network or between layers of an application
without exposing the underlying data model or entities.
